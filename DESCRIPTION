Title: Power Analysis for nonlinear (quadratic and interaction) SEM/ moderated and mediated SEM

Description: Simulation based power analysis for nonlinear (and linear) SEM, path analysis and regression analysis. A theoretical framework is used to approximate the relation between power and sample size for given type I error rates and effect size.
    The package offers a smart search algorithm to find the optimal N for given effect sizes type I error rates. Plots can be used to visualize the power relation to N for different parameters of interst (POI).
